# Voice Pipeline - Cursor Rules

## Build After Changes

After making any changes to TypeScript files in `src/`, always rebuild the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

This is a TypeScript library that compiles to `dist/`. Changes won't take effect until rebuilt.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - TypeScript source files
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output
- `examples/` - Example applications that use the library
